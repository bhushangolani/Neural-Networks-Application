# Neural-Networks-Application

--> Designed a simple neural network from scratch to predict the known relation between two salts
--> Fitted a neural network on the data of one of the salts
--> Used the weigths and biases of this output and multiplied it with the input of the other salt
--> Was able to capture the trend
